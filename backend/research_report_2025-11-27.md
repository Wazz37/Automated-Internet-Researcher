## SUMMARY
The New York Times reports that a major platform is implementing an A.I.-powered age estimation process for users wishing to engage in chat, aiming to enhance safety and compliance on its network. This measure reflects a growing trend towards leveraging artificial intelligence for user verification, raising important discussions about privacy and the reliability of such technologies. Related technical resources include GitHub repositories focused on age estimation techniques, such as "Delta_Age_AdaIN" for binary code age estimation and others exploring game-theoretic approaches to uncertainty in interactions.

## DRAFT LINKEDIN POST

Hey everyone, did you hear about the big platform using AI to check ages for chat users? 🤔 The New York Times just reported this. The goal? Make our online spaces safer and more secure. But it raises questions about our privacy and how reliable this tech really is. 

You know how sometimes you wonder if an age estimate can really tell who’s behind the screen? That's where tech like 'Delta_Age_AdaIN' comes in. Check it out here: https://github.com/redcping/Delta_Age_AdaIN.

What do you think? Is it smart AI safety or a privacy concern?
